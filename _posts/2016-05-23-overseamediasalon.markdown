“Tsinghua’s creative education system has had an enormous impact on my life and entrepreneurial experience. 

I spend half of my time here doing research in the lab and the other half studying different courses outside of my major. Everything I have worked on and experienced here has helped me to understand how businesses operate in the real world.”

	Much easier to get a start here

I think that this is invaluable to students. Most questions and problems can be solved on campus. The teachers are very experienced and helpful and are ready to assist in any way they can.”

	Prepare me well for the future

Looking back to my time at Tsinghua, the chance to develop my entrepreneurial spirit and ability gave me the tools needed to make a new start after graduation. 

The multidisciplinary curriculum built my confidence in taking on new challenges and made me more persistent when faced with obstacles. My experience at Tsinghua also helped me learn to communicate with different kinds of people across various domains.
